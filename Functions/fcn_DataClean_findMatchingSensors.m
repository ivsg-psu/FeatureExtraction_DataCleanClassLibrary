function [matchedSensorNames] = fcn_DataClean_findMatchingSensors(dataStructure, sensor_identifier_string, varargin)

% fcn_DataClean_findMatchingSensors
% Finds which sensors have names that match a given query
%
% FORMAT:
%
%      matchedSensorNames = fcn_DataClean_findMatchingSensors(dataStructure,sensor_identifier_string, (fid))
%
% INPUTS:
%
%      dataStructure: a data structure to be analyzed 
%
%      sensor_identifier_string: a string that is used to select only some
%      sensor fields, matched using lower-case comparisons. For example, if
%      sensor_identifier_string = 'GPS', then all sensors whose names, when
%      coverted to lower case, contain 'gps' will be queried. If there are
%      only 3 sensors with 'gps' in their name, then the resulting
%      dataArray and sensorNames will only have 3 entries.
% 
%      (OPTIONAL INPUTS)
%
%      fid: a file ID to print results of analysis. If not entered, no
%      printing is done. Set fid to 1 to print to the console.
%
% OUTPUTS:
%
%      matchedSensorNames: a structure containing an array of each sensor's name
%      that contains sensor_identifier_string
% 
% DEPENDENCIES:
%
%      fcn_DebugTools_checkInputsToFunctions
