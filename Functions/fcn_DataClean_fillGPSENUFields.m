function convertedDataStructure = fcn_DataClean_fillGPSENUFields(dataStructure, ref_basestation)
% fcn_DataClean_fillGPSENUFields
%
% Converts all GPS fields within the input data structure from LLA 
% (latitude, longitude, altitude) to ENU (East, North, Up) coordinates and
% fill corresponding fields
%
% INPUTS:
%   dataStructure      - A structure containing various sensor fields including GPS
%   ref_basestation    - A 1x3 vector [lat, lon, alt] used as the ENU reference origin
%
% OUTPUT:
%   convertedDataStructure - The updated structure where GPS fields have new fields:
%                             xEast, yNorth, zUp (in meters, ENU frame)
%
% NOTE:
%   This function looks for fields containing 'GPS' in their names.
%   The conversion uses the 'lla2enu' function with the WGS84 ellipsoid model.
