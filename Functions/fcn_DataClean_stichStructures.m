function [stitchedStructure, uncommonFields] = fcn_DataClean_stichStructures(cellArrayOfStructures, varargin)
% fcn_DataClean_stichStructures
% given a cell array of structures, merges all the fields that are common
% among the structures, and lists also the fields that are not common
% across all. A "merge" consists of a vertical concatenation of data, e.g.
% the data rows from structure 1 are stacked above structure 2 which are
% stacked above structure 3, etc. If the data are scalars, the scalars must
% match for all the structures - otherwise they are considered not common.
%
% To merge structures, the following must be true:
%
%      all the merged fields must have the same field names
%
%      all the field entries must all be 1x1 scalars with the same scalar
%      value, OR all the field entries must be NxM vectors where M is the
%      same across structures, but N may be different across the structures
%      and/or across fields.
%
%      if the fields are themselves substructures, then the stitching
%      process is called with the substructures also.
%
%  The function returns an empty stitchedStructure ([]) if there is no
%  merged result. If substructures exist and partially agree, the parts
%  that disagree are indicated withthin uncommonFields using the dot
%  notation, for example: fieldName.disagreedSubFieldName. This is
%  recursive so sub-sub-fields would also be checked and similarly denoted
%  with two dots, etc.
%
% FORMAT:
%
%      [stitchedStructure, uncommonFields] = fcn_DataClean_stichStructures(cellArrayOfStructures, (fig_num))
%
% INPUTS:
%
%      cellArrayOfStructures: a cell array of structures to stitch
%
%      (OPTIONAL INPUTS)
%
%      fig_num: a figure number to plot results. If set to -1, skips any
%      input checking or debugging, no figures will be generated, and sets
%      up code to maximize speed.
%
% OUTPUTS:
%
%      stitchedStructure: a single structure containing all the data from
%      all the structures, ordered in same order as the input cell array
%
%      uncommonFields: a cell array of strings containing the names of any
%      fields that were not common across all the inputs
%
% DEPENDENCIES:
%
%      (none)
